Project Owner: Azra Gostak

About the Project
Study Tracker Candles is a motivation-focused timer application designed to help users set and visually track their weekly study goals. Each concentrated focus session is represented by a digital candle that realistically melts as time progresses. This approach leverages visual progress feedback to help users manage their time effectively and boost motivation.

Key Features
🎯 Goal Setting: Set a total weekly study goal in hours.

✨ Dynamic Candle Generation: The total goal is automatically broken down into multiple candles of varying durations (e.g., 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 hours).

🔥 Top-Down Melting Animation: The candle melts from the top down, providing a visually accurate representation of time expiry.

💧 Realistic Dripping Effect: Wax dripping animation that syncs its height with the melting candle level.

⏱️ Reliable Time Tracking: Implements an absolute time calculation mechanism ensuring the timer remains accurate, even when the browser tab is minimized or running in the background.

📊 Progress Visualization: Tracks and displays the total and completed study hours.
